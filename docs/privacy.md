# üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

## Data Practices üìù

- **Ephemeral Conversations:** Chat¬≤GPT doesn't store or retain conversation history. Every session is temporary, ending when a conversation concludes or times out.

- **Temporary Audio Storage:** Audio files are stored temporarily in Google Cloud Storage to allow users enough time for downloading. To ensure data privacy and efficient storage utilization, these files are deleted with each app redeployment.

- **Reactive Responses:** The bot only reacts to direct prompts, such as @mentions or direct messages, and doesn't "read the room".

- **Anonymous Sessions:** Users are tracked using anonymous ID numbers solely for session consistency. These IDs are cleared with each app redeployment.

## AI APIs and User Awareness ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- **OpenAI's Commitment:** We use OpenAI's APIs, which, as per OpenAI's policy, don't use user inputs for model training. More details are on [OpenAI's official site](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

- **Speechify's Commitment:** We use Speechify's APIs, which, as per Speechify's policy, don't use user inputs for model training. More details are on [Speechify's official site](https://speechify.com/terms).

- **User Awareness:** Discussing sensitive topics? Exercise caution, especially in group settings. Chat¬≤GPT doesn't log conversations, but your organization or platform might.
